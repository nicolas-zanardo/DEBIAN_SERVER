Building from source is not easy if something is a bit different, and I had a hard time with some directory and configuration options. I was floundering around the web until I found this site that translated from Chinese. No one else had the solution.  I couldn't get php fpm to start until I changed the directory (Item 2.ERROR: Unable to globalize). I had other issues listed but I was able to solve them. Please don't delete this, it is very useful info.

The original site  (it is in Chinese, not my site, but I want to give credit):

(there is some more there, you can goto the site)

3. Start php-fpm

1.ERROR: failed to open configuration file '/usr/local/etc/php-fpm.conf': No such file or directory (2) 
ERROR: failed to load configuration file '/usr/local/etc/php-fpm.conf' 
ERROR: FPM initialization failed

solution:

Php-fpm.conf copy files from the source file to that location.

cp /root/php-7.0.0alpha1/sapi/fpm/php-fpm.conf /usr/local/etc/php-fpm.conf

ERROR: failed to load configuration file '/usr/local/etc/php-fpm.conf' 
ERROR: FPM initialization failed

solution:

Edit /usr/local/etc/php-fpm.conf document introduced * .conf part, change to the correct path include = / usr / local / etc / php-fpm.d / *. Conf

If there is no /usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d directory, create the directory.
